# üßæ Organization-Based Crypto Accounting ‚Äì Data Access & Tracking Rules

## Overview - MVP USER FLOW

This tool is designed for organizations (startups, DAOs, dev studios) to manage their **own crypto wallets** ‚Äî tracking inflows, outflows, tagging transactions, uploading attachments, and exporting reports.

It is **not** a wallet spying or surveillance tool. Each organization only has access to wallets they explicitly connect.

   - Invite team members (optional)

2. **Add Org-Owned Wallets**

   - Any wallet address the org controls (e.g., Treasury, Payroll, Vendor Ops)
   - Multi-chain supported (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.)

3. **Sync Transactions Automatically**

   - Native token transfers (e.g., ETH, MATIC)
   - ERC20 transfers
   - Swaps (DEX)
   - Fiat value at transaction time (via CoinGecko)

     - `Customer Payment`
     - `Grant`
     - `Vendor Expense`
     - `Asset Purchase`
