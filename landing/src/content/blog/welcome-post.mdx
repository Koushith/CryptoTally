If you're a startup or freelancer who gets paid in crypto, you've probably faced this situation:

You receive USDC or ETH from a client â†’ forget about it â†’ end up with 100+ transactions â†’ panic when it's time to file taxes or track revenue.

Yeah, same here. That's exactly why we built this crypto accounting tool â€” for folks like us.

## Who am I?

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Koushith, and I'm building CryptoTally solo. My journey into tech has been quite the adventure â€“ starting as a designer, exploring product management, and finally falling in love with software engineering.

I believe great software should feel like magic âœ¨. That's why I obsess over every detail, from pixel-perfect designs to buttery-smooth animations. When you use CryptoTally, you'll notice this attention to detail everywhere â€“ it's not just a tool, it's an experience crafted with care.

### Why build this?

As someone who's worked with DAOs and Web3 projects, I've felt the pain of crypto accounting firsthand. Instead of waiting for someone else to solve it, I decided to build the solution I wished existed. CryptoTally is the result of combining my design sensibilities with engineering capabilities.

Let's make crypto accounting a joy, not a chore! âœ¨
