# In your server directory, run:
cat serviceAccountKey.json | base64

# Copy the output
```

### Railway Dashboard

1. Go to your project â†’ **Variables** tab
2. Add these variables:

```
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64 = <paste base64 string here>
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID = cryptotally-5bdd8
DATABASE_URL = <your Railway postgres URL>
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = 3001

## How to Get Base64 String

### macOS/Linux
```bash
cat serviceAccountKey.json | base64
```

### Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
[Convert]::ToBase64String([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("serviceAccountKey.json"))
```

### Windows (Git Bash)
```bash
cat serviceAccountKey.json | base64
```

## Quick Verification

### Check Local Setup
```bash
# Should see both files:
ls -la serviceAccountKey.json .env

# Should NOT be tracked by git:
git status | grep serviceAccountKey  # No output = good!
```

### Check Railway Setup
```bash
# In Railway logs, you should see:
ðŸ”‘ Loading Firebase service account from base64 environment variable...
âœ… Firebase service account loaded from environment variable
âœ… Firebase Admin SDK initialized successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

|---------|----------|
| "File not found" locally | Download from Firebase Console, save as `serviceAccountKey.json` |
| "Firebase configuration not found" on Railway | Add `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BASE64` to Railway variables |
| "Invalid JSON" error | Re-encode: `cat serviceAccountKey.json \| base64` |
| Changes not working | Restart Railway service or redeploy |
