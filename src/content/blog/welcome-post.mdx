If you're a startup or freelancer who gets paid in crypto, you've probably faced this situation:

You receive USDC or ETH from a client → forget about it → end up with 100+ transactions → panic when it's time to file taxes or track revenue.

Yeah, same here. That's exactly why we built this crypto accounting tool — for folks like us.

## Current Features

At its core, it helps you track your crypto money flow in and out of your wallets. No more messy spreadsheets, no more manually copying transactions from Etherscan.

### MVP Features

#### 1. Wallet Tracking Across Multiple Chains

- See all your balances across Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BNB Chain
- View total value in INR/USD

#### 2. Transaction Sync + Clean UI

- Auto-fetch your on-chain transactions
- Simple timeline of inflows/outflows — like a passbook, but for crypto

#### 3. Tagging Transactions

- Tag them as customer payment, vendor payout, salary, grant, gas fee
- Add notes like invoice ID, project name, etc

#### 4. Real-Time Dashboard

- View income vs expenses per wallet
- Filter by tag, token, wallet, or time

#### 5. CSV Export

## Who am I?

Hey there! 👋 I'm Koushith, and I'm building CryptoTally solo. My journey into tech has been quite the adventure – starting as a designer, exploring product management, and finally falling in love with software engineering.

I believe great software should feel like magic ✨. That's why I obsess over every detail, from pixel-perfect designs to buttery-smooth animations. When you use CryptoTally, you'll notice this attention to detail everywhere – it's not just a tool, it's an experience crafted with care.

### Why build this?

As someone who's worked with DAOs and Web3 projects, I've felt the pain of crypto accounting firsthand. Instead of waiting for someone else to solve it, I decided to build the solution I wished existed. CryptoTally is the result of combining my design sensibilities with engineering capabilities.

Let's make crypto accounting a joy, not a chore! ✨
